## Deploy Static Website on AWS

### Objectives of this project:
> Hosting a static Website on S3 and
> Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service.

### What I did:
1. Created a public S3 bucket and uploaded the website files to my bucket.
2. Configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using IAM policies.
3. Speeded up content delivery using AWS's content distribution network service, CloudFront.
4. I was able to access my website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint

### Endpoint URLs for My Website.
